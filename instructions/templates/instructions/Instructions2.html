<p> 
At each round, you will receive a recommandation from the software on which product to choose, as illustrated below. 
You can freely decide whether or not to follow this recommandation. </p>

<br> 
	<img src="{% static 'screenshot_app2.png' %}"/>
<br>

You do not know exactly how this recommandation is computed, but you have the following informations:
<ul>
	<li> the recommendation depends only on the attributes of the products that appear on the screen </li>
	<li> the way it is computed does not change during the experiment </li>
	<li> it may or may not be helpful for you </li>
</ul>

<p> Let us give an example of how recommendations may be designed. 
The recommended product may be chosen as the best product for someone having the same formula as you for the payoff, but different values for the labels. 
Imagine that for this person the circle is worth 3 point and triangle is worth 4 points, all the other values remaining the same.
<ol>
	<li> The only products those value is affected are those with either a circle or a cross </li> 
	<li> In these six specific products, the only change concenrs the paoff from the thrid product </li>
	<li> <\li>
</ol>
In this particular case, the recommandations in the next rounds would have a tendency to overvalue products with a triangle and undervalue products with a circle. 
Therefore, the recommended product may sometimes be the best for you but sometimes not at all.</p>


<p> Another possibility would be that the recommended product is the best product for an individual having the same values as you for the payoff and label, but the values prices positively.
For instance, this could be the case in a supermarket, where the seller somehow knows your taste but benefits form what you pay. 
In this situation, the recommendations would be biased towards expensive products and thus may be very harmful for you.</p>

<p> Please keep in mind that this were just a few examples and you still do not exactly how the recommandation will be produced during the experiment. 
We invite you to answer the questions below in order to make sure that you have weel understood the information regarding the recommendations.</p>

<p> At the end of the experiment, we will compute the sum of your profits in ECU across all rounds. 
This total is converted into euros according to the rate: 10 ECU = 1€. A fixed fee equal to 10€ is added to this payoff. 
You will be paid privately the corresponding monetary payoff using Lydia after the experiment.</p>

<p> 
Please do not to communicate with any other participants and solve the task on your own without material. 
Otherwise, the results of the experiment will be unusable. 
</p>

Thanks for participating.
