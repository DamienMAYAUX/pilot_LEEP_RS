<p>You will be participating in a virtual shopping game in which you are to choose among different product. 
The currency unit used in the game is the ECU (Experimental Currency Unit).</p>

<p>At each round, you will have to choose one of the products on the screen. 
There will be {{ Constants.num_choice_rounds}} rounds in total, with a different set of {{ Constants.num_products }} products at each round. 
You will not obtain any real product nor will you spend your real money because of your choice in the experiment. 

<p> However, depending on the attributes of the products that you choose, you can improve how much you will get paid at the end of the experiment. 
Each product has three attributes that will determine your payoff: label, nutrition level and price.</p>
<ul>
	<li> 
	There are 5 differents labels (square, circle, triangle, star, cross) and 5 different nutrition levels (A, B, C, D and E). 
	Each label and nutrition level has a certain value in ECU, written on the top of the screen.
	</li>
	<li>
	Prices are numbers with two decimals betwenn 0.80 and 4.80.
	</li>
</ul>

Here is an example of what the screen will look like :
<br> 
	<img src="{% static 'screenshot_app.png' %}"/>
<br>

<p>The amount in ECU that you get from choosing a certain product is equal to the value of the label plus that of the nutrition content minus the price. 
The formula appears at the top of the screen.</p>
<p> The values of the labels and nutrition content given above are the one that will be used in the experiment. 
They will not change from one round to another and will be constantly displayed at the top of your screen as above. 
Your total payoff is the sum of the payoff for all the products that you have bought during the experiment.</p>
<p>

<p> Consider the case depicted above.  </p>
<ul>
	<li> The first product has a square label (worth 5 ECU), a nutritional level E (worth 1 ECU) and a price 3.78 ECU <br> will make you earn 5 + 1 – 3.78 = 2.22 ECU if you buy it.</li>
	<li> The second product has a cross label (worth 1 ECU), a nutritional level A (worth 5 ECU) and a price 3.93 ECU <br> will make you earn 1 + 5 – 3.93 = 2.07 ECU if you buy it.</li>
	<li> The third product has a circle label (worth 4 ECU), a nutritional level D (worth 2 ECU) and a price 1.28 ECU <br> will make you earn 4 + 2 – 1.28 = 4.72 ECU if you buy it.</li>
</ul>

	{% formfields %}

<p> You are supposed to choose one product out of {{ Constants.num_products }} at each round, in less than one minute. 
As soon as you have chosen your product, the software will move to the next round with a new set of {{ Constants.num_products }} products. 
If you do not choose your product in less than one minute, you will loose 1 ECU and the software will move automatically to the next round with a new set of ten products. 
Please do your best to avoid that this situation happen, it is not in your interest and it will affect negatively the results of the experiment.</p>
